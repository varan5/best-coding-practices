# Code Orgainization is one of the best practice
# i.e. Seperate the concerens
# One should try to use packages(folders) and group the related files in them

# Example
'''

-> my_python_project    (root folder)
    -> src
        -> main
            -> main.py file
        -> data
            -> database files
        -> services
            -> third party services 
            -> third party packages
        -> utils
            -> some utilities needed
    -> docs
    -> tests
    ...
