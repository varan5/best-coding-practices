# Avoid Mixed Naming Conventions
# i.e. One should try to be consistent while using the naming convention

# Not being consistent
def my_superb_function(someName):
    print('The best person in the team is: ', someName)



# Being consistent
def my_superb_function(some_name):
    print('The best person in the team is: ', some_name)
